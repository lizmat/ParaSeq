NAME
====

ParaSeq - Parallel execution of Iterables

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use ParaSeq;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

ParaSeq provides the functional equivalent of [`hyper`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterable#method_hyper) and [`race`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterable#method_race), but re-implemented from scratch with all of the experience from the initial implementation of `hyper` and <race> in 2014, and using features that have since been added to the Raku Programming Language.

As such it exports two subroutines `hyperize` and `racify`, to make them plug-in compatible with the [`hyperize`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/hyperize) distribution.
