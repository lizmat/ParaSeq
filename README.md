NAME
====

ParaSeq - Parallel execution of Iterables

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use ParaSeq;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

ParaSeq provides the functional equivalent of [`hyper`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterable#method_hyper) and [`race`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Iterable#method_race), but re-implemented from scratch with all of the experience from the initial implementation of `hyper` and <race> in 2014, and using features that have since been added to the Raku Programming Language.

As such it exports two subroutines `hyperize` and `racify`, to make them plug-in compatible with the [`hyperize`](https://raku.land/zef:lizmat/hyperize) distribution.

IMPROVEMENTS
============

Automatic batch size adaptation
-------------------------------

One of the main issues with the current implemementation of `.hyper` and `.race` in the Rakudo core is that the batch size is fixed. Worse, there is no way to dynamically adapt the batch size depending on the load.

Batch sizes that are too big, have a tendency to not use all of the CPUs (because they have a tendency to eat all of the source items too soon, thus removing the chance to start up more threads).

Batch sizes that are too small, have a tendency to have their resource usage drowned out by the overhead of batching and dispatching to threads.

This implementation aims to adapt batch sizes from the originally (implicitely) specified one for better throughput and resource usage.

Unnecessary parallelization
---------------------------

If the `degree` specified is **1**, then there is no point in batching or parallelization. In that case, this implementation will take itself completely out of the flow.

Alternately, if the initial batch size is large enough to exhaust the source, it is clearly too large. Which is interpreted as not making any sense at parallelization either. So it won't.

Note that the default initial batch size is **10**, rather than **64** in the current implementation of `.hyper` and `.race`, making the chance smaller that parallelization is abandoned too soon.

Loop control statements
-----------------------

Some loop control statements may affect the final result. Specifically the `last` statement does. In the current implementation of `.hyper` and `.race`, this will only affect the batch in which it occurs.

This implementation aims to make `last` stop any processing of current and not create anymore batches.

Support more interface methods
------------------------------

Currently only the `.map` and `.grep` methods are completely supported by the current implementation of `.hyper` and `.race`. Other methods, such as `.first`, will also be supported.

Use of phasers
--------------

When an interface method takes a `Callable`, then that `Callable` can contain phasers that may need to be called (or not called) depending on the situation. The current implementation of `.hyper` and `.race` do not allow phasers at all.

This implementation aims to support phasers in a sensible manner:

### ENTER

Called before each iteration.

### FIRST

Called on the first iteration in the first batch.

### NEXT

Called at the end of each iteration.

### LAST

Called on the last iteration in the last batch. Note that this can be short-circuited with a `last` control statement.

### LEAVE

Called after each iteration.
